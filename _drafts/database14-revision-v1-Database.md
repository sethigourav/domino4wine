Grails4Notes (TM)

## Which Holy Grail do you seek, fearless Notes / Domino / XPages coder?

_I wish I could…_

  * _Magically_ make my IBM Lotus Notes (R) data relational by annotating it using a simple web interface.

  * Keep my Notes data in the NSF while _also_ having it available using true SQL served by a true RDBMS. (currently unidirectional)

  * Avoid costly SQL licensing by using the powerful Postgres server which runs on all platforms and has features comparable to expensive commercial systems like Microsoft (R) SQL Server (R).

  * Use true SQL language queries to report on my data — even when it is stored across many NSF databases or servers.

  * Mix the mature security model, reliable replication technology for clustered / off-line use, and rapid application NoSQL-style development of Notes with cutting-edge dynamic language technology from coders _so_ good at Java they invented something even better: Groovy/Grails.

  * Use the powerful Grails framework and Groovy programming language to interact with my data in a more natural, object-oriented way (in addition to using SQL).

  * Avoid learning SQL by using modern language syntax to write natural coder-friendly statements like: _book = Book.findByTitleLike(&#8220;Harry Pot%”)_

  * Never again have to use the NotesSQL driver or BIRT reporting server.

  * Stop writing custom Java or Lotuscript agents to query Notes data in a more complex fashion than can be done with view selection formula syntax.

  * Develop a true Business Object Model for the data in my Notes databases.

  * Easily create formal documentation in the industry-standard JavaDoc-like format for all of my fields and shared fields on all of my forms and subforms in Notes.

  * Use professional RDBMS database tools such as Navicat (R) Data Modeler Essentials (R) to finally see the true relationships between my Notes data.

  * Eliminate unnecessary views from my Notes databases because they clutter my design and slow down performance for large databases.

  * Stop worrying that my Notes views have too many documents in them by optionally eliminating the reporting views and shifting that workload to more appropriate SQL queries and reports.

  * Use the industry-leading Crystal Reports (R) natively against my data to produce nice graphs.

  * Performance optimize the necessary sections of my Domino classic or newer XPages web applications.

  * Gain insight into the slowest URLs of my Domino classic or newer XPages web applications so I can improve my customer’s web experience.

  * Analyze my existing Java agent code to see exactly how many API calls are made to lotus.domino.* API to help me estimate good candidates for conversion to Groovy / Grails.

[work in progress items below this line…]

  * Create native mobile phone (iPhone & Android) and desktop apps (Mac and Windows) with real-time data updates of my Notes data using a consistent User Interface that delivers on the write-once-run-everywhere promise. _Depends upon Apache Flex, Adobe AIR, and Granite Data Services WebSocket technology._

  * Access rich text context in SQL and use advanced tools like Apache Solr for improved full text index support.

  * Browse from a store of pre-made free and paid Grails4Notes applications which help map my existing Notes databases such as names.nsf or even my mail databases in new and exciting ways. For example, I would like to have a more intelligent CRM by data mining my company’s Notes e-mail proactively to see which opportunities my company is not responding to quickly enough.

  * Purchase from a catalog of Notes design elements, or share ones I build for free with others to help develop my reputation in the Notes ecosystem’s first curated design element store.

  * Find a curated, affordable, and professional set of firms interested in helping me modernize my Notes / Domino / XPages applications.

  * Have bi-directional synchronization from the SQL and Notes data.

  * (under consideration for roadmap) run any existing Domino Java agent in Grails (because we re-implemented sections of the lotus.domino.* API).

_The Groovy / Grails framework is open source, free software with no cumbersome commercial licensing requirements and runs on any Java Virtual Machine and therefore all operating systems. More importantly, it also can call and be called by any existing Java code already in use._
